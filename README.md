In this assignment, students will design and implement a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Python and the Tkinter library. The goal is to create a basic drawing application similar to Microsoft Paint, where users can draw, erase, and interact with various drawing tools such as brushes and colors. Through this project, students will explore fundamental concepts in UI/UX design, event handling, and graphical programming while gaining hands-on experience with Tkinter, a powerful toolkit for building user interfaces in Python. This assignment will emphasize both functionality and the importance of user-friendly design principles.
In addition to the basic drawing tools, students are encouraged to extend their programs by implementing optional features. These may include:

· Shape tools: Allow users to draw shapes such as rectangles, circles, and lines.
· Fill tool: Add functionality to fill closed shapes with a selected color.
· Customizable brush sizes: Give users the ability to change the size of their brush for more precise drawing.
· Undo/Redo functionality: Implement a system to track user actions and allow them to revert or redo their changes.
· Save and open files: Allow users to save their drawings as image files and open previously saved work.
· Color picker: Provide an interactive color palette or picker for custom color selection.
· Layer system: Introduce multiple layers for drawing, similar to advanced graphic design tools, where users can draw on different layers and manipulate them independently.

By adding these features, students will not only enhance the functionality of their programs but also learn how to manage more complex GUI interactions and develop a richer, more versatile user experience.

# tkinterAssignment


1.	Set Up the Environment:
	•	Install Python (if not already installed).
	•	Ensure Tkinter is installed (it typically comes with Python).
2.	Create a Tkinter Window:
	•	Initialize the main window using Tk().
3.	Set Up the Canvas:
	•	Create a canvas widget where the drawing will take place.
	•	Define the size and background color of the canvas.
4.	Add a Brush Tool:
	•	Capture mouse events like left-click and drag to draw lines.
	•	Use mouse position to determine where to draw on the canvas.
5.	Implement Color Selection:
	•	Add basic color options (e.g., buttons or a simple palette).
6.	Add an Eraser Tool:
	•	Implement a tool that draws with the background color to “erase” drawn content.
7.	Create a Simple Menu:
	•	Add a simple menu or toolbar for selecting tools (brush, eraser, colors).
8.	Run the Application:
	•	Implement the main loop to keep the application running.
